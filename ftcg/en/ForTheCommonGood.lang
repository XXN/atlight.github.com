#                    Don't translate as "success", since it isn't guaranteed success.
LooksGood=Looks good to me.
# LOCALIZATION NOTE: probably do not translate "Partial Trust" - it is .NET jargon - but do translate "scenario"
LinkVisitFailed=Can't open this link - you need to run FtCG locally, not in a Partial Trust scenario.
# LOCALIZATION NOTE: if I didn't have a sense of humour this would read:
#                    "You did not select a version to transfer. Please select only one item from the list before clicking OK."
