	<h2>Language files for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:This,_that_and_the_other/For_the_Common_Good">For the Common Good</a></h2>
	<p>
		For the Common Good is fully localizable - its user interface can be translated into any language. 
		(See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:This,_that_and_the_other/For_the_Common_Good/Languages">this page</a> for more information about language files.)
	</p>
	<h3>How to use language files</h3>
	<p>
		To use the translation, simply unzip the file (it must be named "ForTheCommonGood.lang") into the same folder as FtCG.
	</p>
	<h3>List of contributed language files</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="ForTheCommonGood_ru.zip">Russian</a> <small>(contributed by Rubin16)</small></li>
	</ul>
	<p>A big thanks to those who have contributed language files for their language.</p>
	<h3>Translating FtCG into your language</h3>
	<p>
		To begin with, copy the <a href="https://raw.github.com/atlight/ForTheCommonGood/master/ForTheCommonGood/DefaultStrings.lang">latest English version</a> to a plain text file named "ForTheCommonGood.lang" and translate it into your language.
		When you are finished, or if you require assistance, please <a href="mailto:at.light@live.com.au?subject=FtCG%20language%20file">e-mail TTO</a> (with your ForTheCommonGood.lang file attached).
	</p>
	<p>To keep your translation up to date, please keep an eye on the <a href="https://github.com/atlight/ForTheCommonGood/commits/master/ForTheCommonGood/DefaultStrings.lang">localization history page</a>. If people are interested, I could set up a translators' mailing list.</p>
